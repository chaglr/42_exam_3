This is a sample text file.
It contains multiple lines of text.
Some of these lines are empty.

But that's not all.
There are also lines that are longer than the buffer size used in get_next_line.
This means that the function will have to read the file multiple times to get these lines.

And finally, there is a line that does not end with a newline character.
This is an edge case that get_next_line should be able to handle as well.
